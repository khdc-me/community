# pyslackers Community
Welcome to the pyslackers community!

Here, you'll find a collection of community-specific resources such as rules,
codes of conduct, locations of team services, etc.

If you are a new pyslacker, then :taco:s to you. Be sure to read
[our introduction document](introduction.md) where you can learn all about
[taco bot](introduction.md#taco-bot-taco) and view guidelines on how to introducing
yourself to everyone, how to ask questions, and general etiquette in a virtual team
environment.

pyslackers are constantly looking for ways to improve their Python skills. If this is you,
but aren't sure what your next step should be, consider:
* taking a look at [our community projects](community_projects.md) and helping resolve issues
or add features
* reading [suggestions](whats_next.md) about books, code challenges, and programming
languages that complement Python
